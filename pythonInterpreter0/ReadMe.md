    Arrays
        ✓ vName = []
        ✓ vName = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
        ✓ vName = [1 + 2, a + b, 5 - 3 * 2, 7, b + 9]
        ✓ vName = ["Data Structures", "Programming Languages", "Operating Systems"]
        ✓ a = arr[3 + 2] + 5
        X - arr[3] = arr[2] * 5 
            Note: This is not supported in the grammar we were asked to implement

        ✓ len(arrayName) # returns the number of elements of arrayName. This is a primary
        ✓ arrayName.push(test) 
        X arrayName.pop()
            - We followed the grammer -> arrayName.pop(<test>) One MUST include an index to pop
        ✓ Calculate Fibonacci (impress FAANG recruiters / interviewers)

    Functions
        ✓ Returns work
        X Returns inside of if statments / for statements
            - Doesn't throw ... just ignored
            - We sent you an email about this early on in the grammar. Allowing this would allow return statements outside of functions 
                breaking the rules of the parser
